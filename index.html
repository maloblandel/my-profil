	     <h2>⛓DeFi (Decentralized Finance)⛓</h2>

	     <p>
	        I've been interested in crytpocurrencies since 2 years from now. 
	     </p>

	     <p>
	        Something that started out as simple curiosity about virtual currencies from the internet ecosystem has increasingly turned into daily use of a new technology carrying convictions like the <strong>shift to financial freedom</strong>. 
	     </p>

	     <p>
	        DeFi is one of the reasons why I want to learn how to code, to be able to build Dapps (decentralized applications).
	        Here you will find my favorite Dapps among all those I use :

	     <h2>🏀Basketball🏀</h2>
	     <p>
		 I used to be a big football fan and then I discovered the NBA and fell in love with basketball. This sport has awakened in me <strong>a curiosity and an interest that goes far beyond the courts</strong>. 
         </p>
        
         <p>
         Indeed, I started to be interested in the NBA in its management aspect, especially from the point of view of the front offices which are the people working inside each team (salary cap, data analyst,...). Being able to know the different types/name of contracts given according to players caliber and generally speaking knowing the actors and rules that structure the NBA allowed me to better understand not only the games but also the directions taken by the league (broadcasting rights contracts with espn and tencent).
         </p>

		 <p>
		 Here you'll find the "cba mastery" that I worked on, it's an FAQ style data base with all the information and explanation necessary to understand the 2017 cba (body of rules of the NBA):
